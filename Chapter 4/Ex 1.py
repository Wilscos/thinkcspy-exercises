# Exercise 1

# Write a program that prints We like Python's turtles! 100 times.

# You just need a for loop
for i in range(100):
    print("We like Python's turtles!")

# Alternative using a while loop
sentence = "We like Python's turtles!"
current_iteration = 0
while current_iteration < 100:
    print(sentence)
    current_iteration += 1
    print(current_iteration)
