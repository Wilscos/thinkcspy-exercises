# Thinkcspy Exercises

My solutions to the exercises of the book "How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition" (https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html)

The exercises of the first chapter are very easy, therefore I decided to not include them. For Chapter 3 there are no exercises to do at the moment I'm doing this.
