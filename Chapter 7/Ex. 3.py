# Exercise 3

# Write a function which is given an exam mark, and it returns a string â€” the grade for that mark â€” according to
# this scheme (check it on the book)

# The square and round brackets denote closed and open intervals. A closed interval includes the number, and open
# interval excludes it. So 79.99999 gets grade C , but 80 gets grade B.
# Test your function by printing the mark and the grade for a number of different marks.
